HTML5 implementation of basic streaming service, inspired by [AAudio](https://koke228.ru/anusaudio)
### Features
- Playback files from other websites (look inside [`/track/1/index.html`](https://github.com/kektris/kekaudio/blob/main/track/1/index.html))
- Easy customization with CSS
- Includes metadata about instance and about tracks
- Has its own, but buggy API (look inside [`kektris/kekaudio-api`](https://github.com/kektris/kekaudio-api))
- Has addons, that can easily supplement your instance
## This project has got a lot of shitcode, but it works fine
