# kekaudio
HTML implementation of basic streaming service, inspired by [AAudio](https://koke228.ru/anusaudio)
### Features
- Upload files from another websites (look [`/track/1/index.html`](https://github.com/kektris/kekaudio/blob/main/track/index.html))
- Easy Customization with CSS
## This project has got a lot of shitcode ~~and backdoors~~, so i dont recommend using it
But anyways, if you want to deploy it on your server, just `git clone` it and modify files as you like.
